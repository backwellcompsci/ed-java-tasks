Small tasks and mini projects in Java, by Ed.
Java sucks.

## Repo folder structure
1. Repo (ed-java-tasks) seperates small Java practice tasks from other people, languages and projects.
2. Time folder (YYMMDD) seperates days of work â€“ earliest date is persistant.
3. Project folder (ClassName) seperates tasks.
4. File heading displays task, name and date started.
