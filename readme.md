# ed-java-tasks
Small tasks and mini projects in Java, by Ed.
  
Java sucks.

## Repo folder structure
1. Repo (ed-java-tasks) seperates small Java practice tasks from other people, languages and major projects.
2. Time folder (YYMMDD) seperates days of work. Earliest date is persistant.
3. Project folder (ClassName) seperates distinct tasks.
4. File heading displays task, name and date started.
